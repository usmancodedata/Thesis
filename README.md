## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Bladder cancer presents significant age-related heterogeneity in its molecular landscape and outcomes. This project leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)â€”specifically **GraphSAGE**â€”to identify **age-specific biomarkers** by integrating **multi-omics data** including:

- mRNA Expression  
- DNA Methylation  
- Copy Number Alterations (CNA)

Patient **age** is embedded as both a **graph feature and a stratification factor**, enabling the model to capture nuanced age-dependent molecular signatures. The model achieved:

- **Accuracy**: 82.84%  
- **AUC**: 0.8804
